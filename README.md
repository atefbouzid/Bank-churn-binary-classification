# Simple Binary Classification Project: Bank Churn Prediction

This project explores binary classification using a bank churn dataset. The goal is to predict whether a customer continues with their account or closes it (i.e., churns).

The dataset used is from a Kaggle competition on bank churn prediction: [Bank Churn Prediction Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e1/overview).

## Background

The project focuses more on domain analysis and gaining insights from the dataset rather than advanced machine learning techniques. The primary emphasis was on understanding the domain-specific features and their relationships with the target variable.

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration**: Dive deep into the dataset to understand the distribution of features, identify patterns, and uncover potential insights.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Perform basic feature engineering to create new features.

3. **Model Selection**: Choose simple machine learning models such as CatBoost Classifier for the classification task.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using standard metrics like area under the ROC curve.

## Achievements

Despite the simplicity of the approach, the project achieved a top 10% ranking in the Kaggle competition. This highlights the importance of domain analysis and understanding the data context in achieving competitive results.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank-churn-binary-classification.git
